# My Tech Blog 3000

## Description

- This app was made with the intent on gaining real world experience with making API
  calls. In this app, we have set up all the routes and associations to be able to access data from a server. Our choice was MongoDB to host our data. This application does not have an interface. There are just routes and datapoints have are tested in Insomia

### Usage

- The way that we use this application, is we run npm run dev to start the server. After this, we set up the checks in Insomnia. We basically run through every endpoint from the Users, and the Though models we have set up. In Insomnia, we are able to link some thought to some user, users, to users, and use CRUD operations to access info about those users.
